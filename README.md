# Tumbling with Tornadoes:
A Tornado Simulation Project
Jesus Olivera and Pujita Ravichandar


# Abstract
This project explores historical tornado tracks data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association 
(NOAA), the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), the National Weather Service 
(NWS), and the Homeland-Infrastructure Foundation Level Data (HIFLD). The goal of this project is to model the magnitude 
of tornadoes, create a mathematical model of the angular velocity, and model the economic losses caused by tornadoes of 
various magnitudes in the Fujita Scale. The best resulting logistic regression model for the magnitude prediction yielded an 
accuracy score of 0.707, the angular velocity simulations followed the expected relationship trends described by the laws of 
circular motion, and the linear regression model used for the economic loss model yielded an RSME (Root Mean Square 
Error) of 18.5 and an R2 (Coefficient of Determination) of 0.31. This study is a solid introduction into using data science, 
computational math/statistics, and machine learning in the field of storm and weather studies.
