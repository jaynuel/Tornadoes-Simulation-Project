# Tumbling with Tornadoes:
A Tornado Simulation Project
Jesus Olivera and Pujita Ravichandar


# Abstract
This project explores historical tornado tracks data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association 
(NOAA), the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), the National Weather Service 
(NWS), and the Homeland-Infrastructure Foundation Level Data (HIFLD). The goal of this project is to model the magnitude 
of tornadoes, create a mathematical model of the angular velocity, and model the economic losses caused by tornadoes of 
various magnitudes in the Fujita Scale. The best resulting logistic regression model for the magnitude prediction yielded an 
accuracy score of 0.707, the angular velocity simulations followed the expected relationship trends described by the laws of 
circular motion, and the linear regression model used for the economic loss model yielded an RSME (Root Mean Square 
Error) of 18.5 and an R2 (Coefficient of Determination) of 0.31. This study is a solid introduction into using data science, 
computational math/statistics, and machine learning in the field of storm and weather studies.

# Our Motivations
Tornadoes are one of the most violent and damaging atmospheric storms we experience. There is still 
much that is unknown about them. They are rare, deadly, difficult to predict, and can cause millions of dollars in 
damage per year. The U.S. has the highest concentration of tornado events in the world. Understanding how these 
storm systems work and using data to help improve prediction methods is integral in gaining more knowledge 
about these great storms. This exploration can be used to help tornado forecasts, warnings, damages, and other 
natural disaster damage control.

# About the Dataset
This dataset contains information about historical tornado tracks in the continental United States, Alaska, 
Hawaii, and Puerto Rico from 1950 to 2015. The data is from the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data 
(HIFLD). The values are gathered from the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), Nation Centers for Environmental 
Protection (NCEP), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Link to the dataset:
